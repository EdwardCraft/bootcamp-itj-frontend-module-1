                <h2>
                    ITJ wants to commemorate the World Engineering Day 2022
                </h2>
                <p>Engineers have had a massive influence on economic prosperity and quality of life by inventing and
                    developing new technologies, from pioneers of productivity improvements to the determination and
                    logistics for implementing them.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Engineering is a remarkable and extraordinary profession that encompasses a wide range of
                    disciplines,
                    from the oldest, military and civil engineering feats, to mechanical, electrical, electronic, and
                    chemical engineering, as well as more recently emerging fields like environmental engineering
                    mechatronics (combining mechanical and electronics), biomedical, biochemical, and others yet to be
                    named.</p>
                <p>UNESCO has declared Thursday, March 4, 2021, as World Engineering Day for sustainable development.
                    The
                    day provides an opportunity to recognize engineers’ and engineering’s contributions to our modern
                    world
                    and increase public awareness of how engineering and technology are essential to everyday living and
                    sustainable development. This day provides the opportunity to promote engineering as a vocation
                    while
                    emphasizing how engineering can improve the world. Engineers all across the globe have made
                    significant
                    progress in supporting the SDGs and improving engineering capacity for the SDGs, guided by the 2030
                    Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>
